- [IdentifiedModules](https://github.com/xdlg/Qt-Examples/tree/main/IdentifiedModules) - How to setup a custom QML module (i.e. a namespace containing reusable QML components) that can be imported anywhere by name.
- [ModelViewPresenter](https://github.com/xdlg/Qt-Examples/tree/main/ModelViewPresenter) - Simple Model-View-Presenter architecture with a C++ model, a C++ presenter registered as instantiable type in QML, and a QML view.
- [ImageGenerator](https://github.com/xdlg/Qt-Examples/tree/main/ImageGenerator) - C++ object generating a dynamic image and making it available to QML via a `QQuickImageProvider`.
